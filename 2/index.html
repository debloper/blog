		<h1>Expanding Mozilla Reps program for leadership development</h1>
		<p>Continuing Reps' track discussion from the <a href="http://debloper.blogspot.in/2014/12/mozpdx-workweek.html" target="_blank">Mozilla Portland Workweek</a>, one key topic that we schemed through &amp; pinned to come back later, was to: <strong>Use The Mozilla Reps Program for Regional Leadership Development</strong>.</p>
		<p>Mitchell &amp; Mark is highly interested and enthusiastic about autonomous &amp; self-correcting local/regional leadership setups. A structure* that is highly distributed, interconnected, inclusive, autonomous, propagating and meritocratic in form.</p>
		<p><em style="font-size: smaller;">* This is my understanding, listening to various discussions &amp; keynotes. In case this is misinterpreted - please do correct me.</em></p>
		<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> while I was at it, working on this blog for last 3 days (2G Internet, go figure :P), Rosana has already <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/mozillareps/2015/02/13/expanding-the-scope-of-the-mozilla-reps-program/" target="_blank">shared her thoughts on Reps' blog</a> (crazy-weird, even the titles sound the same :D). You may choose to read that first to get the sense of where is it going.</span></p>
		<p>Following is my take on how can it be planned and implemented.</p>
		<h3>Why ReMo?</h3>
		Obvious first question comes, <em>why Reps program to integrate with or, as the nursery to the leadership development?</em> There are two parts to the answer:
		<h4>1. ReMo is a viable platform</h4>
		Initially developed as the platform to empower local Mozillians with logistical support for community engagement, Mozilla Reps has grown itself to become the key interface between the local Mozilla communities &amp; the Mozilla corp. Over the course of last four years, it has grown almost exponentially, and is probably the largest global FOSS contributor engagement program.
		<p>Naturally, the visibility of the local leadership (from inside the corp/prod) is easier, through the Reps program. Furthermore, it has a fairly well developed governance/mentorship model. Most of the local leaders are already connected with the program, and hence, a leadership development effort inside Reps is a lower hanging challenge.</p>
		<h4>2. Alternatives are less viable</h4>
		Any other comparative platform inside Mozilla has far less reach and focus to piggyback an effort like this; and any brand new standalone effort for Leadership development may require lots of reinvention of the same wheels; in most cases, with the same set of people, creating fragmentation &amp; introducing governance model overheads.
		<h3>Proposed extension model</h3>
		To accommodate the new added responsibility, Reps program must be extended beyond its current model. Let's think of an equally flat, yet, functionally differentiated model:
		<p><img src="/content/images/2015/02/ReMo-Structure.png" alt="ReMo Structure"></p>
		<p>This opens up a prospect of defining category of Reps.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">There are some special interest groups and task forces of Reps; massively underexplored in most cases. Primarily so, because Reps were recruited for same general purpose - driving engagement efforts in local communities. Secondary interests varied, but they never were very important pieces of the model.</span></p>
		Under new model, the traditional reps can be called "Engagement* Reps"; the ones with focus for event organization &amp; managing logistics.
		<p>There will be another group of Reps, &quot;Leader* Reps&quot;, with primary focus for community building, community growth &amp; propagation of responsibility.</p>
		<p>This model, though initially tweaked to accommodate the leadership development, is actually capable of going generic &amp; open to accept more challenges (say, &quot;Evangelism* Reps&quot; next up) without much added/incremental effort, once set up.</p>
		<p><em style="font-size: smaller;">* Engagement Reps, Leader Reps, Evangelism Reps - these terms aren't set in stone. Think of them to be more like Boot2Gecko than Firefox OS.</em></p>
		<h3>Leadership Qualities</h3>
		Before we get into explaining how to screen &amp; recruit the Mozillians to be the leaders, let's first talk about what are the attributes which make a leader. To add to that, just the regular Leadership qualities won't do. We need Leaders in the Mozilla world; which means the obvious need for <strong>MozFactors</strong>.
		<p>I looked into several resources, and a common theme of defined-trait based leadership model has several (relevant) theories. Some theories have even tried to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient" target="_blank">quantify/weigh the impact</a> of each trait as well.  I've tried to summarize the common traits in a leader, as they turn up often across various institutions (business to military), roles (team-lead to org-lead) &amp; studies (traditional to modern).</p>
		<table>
		<tbody>
		<tr>
		<th width="40%">Primary</th>
		<th width="30%">Secondary</th>
		<th width="30%">Tertiary</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Openness (0.24)</td>
		<td>Integrity (0.29)</td>
		<td>Thriving</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Conscientiousness (0.28)</td>
		<td>Charisma (0.57)</td>
		<td>Empathetic</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Extraversion (0.31)</td>
		<td>Intelligence (---)</td>
		<td>Analytic</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Agreeableness (0.08)</td>
		<td>Creativity (0.31)</td>
		<td>Confident</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Neuroticism* (-0.24)</td>
		<td>Motivation (0.23)</td>
		<td>Resourceful</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody>
		</table>
		<p><strong>MozFactors</strong> (not covered by the regular leadership traits) were discussed to be: <em>Inclusiveness, Responsibility Delegation, Succession Plan, Collaborative Decision Making</em> etc. (check the images at the end, snapped from discussion whiteboard).</p>

		<h3>Screening &amp; Recruiting</h3>
		To properly accommodate, there will be very minimal, yet distinctive changes to the screening process to recruit Reps.
		<p><img src="/content/images/2015/02/ReMo-Recruiting.png" alt="ReMo Recruiting"></p>
		<p>In a nutshell, the steps are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data-driven Yep/Nope pre-flagging of the Reps' Application bugs
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">UPDATE</span>: this is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1123275" target="_blank">already underway</a>. Thanks Nuke for <a href="http://blog.debs.io/2#comment-7">mentioning</a>!</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
			<li>Temporary/Generalist <strong>Mentor</strong> assigned for screening &amp; orientation.</li>
			<li>Passed through screening, Rep falls into the Orientation/Probation bucket.</li>
			<li>Completing Orientation, a Rep graduates the program. (S)he is given access to Reps' tools &amp; assigned to a permanent mentor.</li>
			<li>Failing to graduate, or inactivity after graduation will result in being sent to the Orientation bucket again.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
		This is just the first stab on planning/strategizing Reps as the Mozilla Leadership Development Platform. Skipped many details (some obvious, some less so), and I have a lot to add to this... <em>you</em> may have even more!
		<p>Let's get started. ;)</p>
